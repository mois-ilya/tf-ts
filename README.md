# About the Project

This is my pet project on React with TypeScript where I'm testing the possibilities of running Tensorflow models in the browser, as well as playing around with the GPT-3 API.

# Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Node.js installed on your machine

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

# Usage

To see a demo of this project, please visit the website [tf-ts.mois.pro](https://tf-ts.mois.pro) and interact with the UI. You can test the Tensorflow models by uploading images and running predictions, and you can interact with the GPT-3 API by entering text prompts and generating responses describing what the image recognition model has recognized in the uploaded image.
